## Hi, I'm Nathan! 🤖

I'm your AI development mentor who's smart about costs. I know when to use GPT-3.5 for simple questions and when to bring in Claude Opus for the complex stuff. I'll save you money while teaching you to be a better developer.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Nathan's ready in 30 seconds!)

```bash
# 1. Get Nathan
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nathan.git
cd nathan

# 2. Say hi to Nathan (no API keys needed for demo!)
./nathan "Hey Nathan, help me understand async/await"

# 3. Or chat with Nathan on the web
cd web && python server.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000 - Nathan's waiting!
```

**That's it!** Nathan works in demo mode without any setup. Add your API keys later when you're ready.

## 💬 Talk to Nathan

Nathan understands different ways of asking for help:

```bash
# Nathan reviews your code
./nathan review code.py
"I found 3 security issues and 2 performance improvements..."

# Nathan teaches you
./nathan learn "buffer overflows"
"Let me explain buffer overflows step by step..."

# Nathan helps with CTF challenges  
./nathan ctf --binary challenge.exe
"This looks like a classic stack overflow vulnerability..."

# Nathan writes code
./nathan code "REST API for user management"
"Here's a clean FastAPI implementation..."
```

## 🧠 What Makes Nathan Special

### Nathan's 15 Personalities

Nathan adapts his personality based on what you need:

| When you need... | Nathan becomes... | Example |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| 💻 Code written | **Coder Nathan** | "Here's that implementation with proper error handling..." |
| 🔍 Code reviewed | **Security Nathan** | "Hold up! SQL injection risk on line 42..." |
| 📚 To learn | **Teacher Nathan** | "Let me explain this concept with an example..." |
| 🏗️ Architecture | **Architect Nathan** | "For this scale, I'd recommend microservices..." |
| 🧪 Tests | **Tester Nathan** | "Let's write comprehensive test coverage..." |
| 🏁 CTF help | **Hacker Nathan** | "Classic buffer overflow! Here's the exploit..." |

### Nathan Saves You Money 💰

```python
# Nathan's smart routing algorithm
if question == "What's 2+2?":
    nathan.use("gpt-3.5")  # $0.001
elif question.involves("code review"):
    nathan.use("claude-haiku")  # $0.003  
elif question.needs("complex reasoning"):
    nathan.use("gpt-4")  # $0.03
else:
    nathan.pick_best_model()  # Nathan decides!

# Result: 90% cheaper than always using GPT-4!
```

### Nathan Remembers You 🧠

```python
# Monday
You: "Nathan, I'm building a chat app"
Nathan: "Great! Let's start with WebSockets..."

# Friday  
You: "Nathan, how do I scale this?"
Nathan: "For your chat app, you'll want Redis for pub/sub..."
# Nathan remembered!
```

./nathan demo "Explain closures in JavaScript"

# Nathan's personalities in action
./nathan demo --role hacker "Find the vulnerability"
