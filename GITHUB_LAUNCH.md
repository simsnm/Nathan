Show HN: Nathan - An AI dev companion that saves 90% on API costs

Hi HN! After my 100+ file "revolutionary AI IDE" failed spectacularly, I rebuilt 
everything in 3 days as "Nathan" - a simple AI companion who knows when to use 
GPT-3.5 ($0.001) vs Claude Opus ($0.06).

Nathan has 15 personalities (Teacher Nathan, Security Nathan, Hacker Nathan for 
CTF challenges) and saves money by routing each question to the cheapest capable 
model.

What makes Nathan different:
- Works in demo mode without API keys (try it immediately)
- Teaches while solving (not just code completion)
- Remembers conversations across sessions
- Deploys to production in 30 minutes
- Under 3000 lines total (vs my original 50,000+ line mess)

The name? I wanted something memorable and personal. "Nathan" makes AI feel 
approachable, like a helpful colleague rather than a cold tool.

GitHub: https://github.com/yourusername/nathan
Try now: git clone ... && ./nathan demo "Explain async/await"

Would love your feedback! What would make Nathan more helpful for you?

From 100+ files of vaporware to "Nathan" - a working AI mentor in 3 days

I learned a hard lesson about over-engineering. My "revolutionary AI IDE" with 
microservices, event sourcing, and 100+ files didn't even run.

So I burned it all down and rebuilt as "Nathan" - a friendly AI companion who:
- Routes questions to the cheapest capable AI model (saves 90% on costs)
- Has 15 personalities (from Teacher Nathan to Hacker Nathan)
- Actually works (demo mode included, no API keys needed)
- Deploys in 30 minutes on a $5 VPS

The entire platform is under 3000 lines. Nathan taught me that simplicity beats 
complexity every time.

Yes, I named my AI assistant. It makes the interaction feel more personal and 
Nathan is definitely more memorable than "AI-Platform-v2".

### Twitter/X Thread
```
ðŸ§µ I named my AI coding assistant Nathan and people love it

1/ Started with 100+ files of over-engineered "AI platform" that didn't work

2/ Rebuilt in 3 days as "Nathan" - a friendly AI who knows when to use cheap 
models vs expensive ones

3/ Nathan has 15 personalities:
- Teacher Nathan explains concepts
- Security Nathan finds vulnerabilities  
- Hacker Nathan helps with CTF challenges
- Coder Nathan writes implementations

4/ The name makes it personal. "Ask Nathan" feels better than "Query the AI 
Platform API Endpoint"

5/ Nathan saves 90% on AI costs by routing:
Simple questions â†’ GPT-3.5 ($0.001)
Code reviews â†’ Claude Haiku ($0.003)
Complex stuff â†’ GPT-4 ($0.06)

6/ Try Nathan without API keys:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nathan
./nathan demo "Explain closures"

7/ Nathan taught me: Simple > Complex, Personal > Corporate, Working > Perfect

ðŸš€ Launching Nathan: An AI Development Companion

After watching my over-engineered "AI platform" fail, I learned that simplicity 
wins. In 3 days, I rebuilt everything as "Nathan" - a friendly AI assistant who 
helps developers while saving them money.

Nathan demonstrates:
âœ… Pragmatic engineering over complexity
âœ… User focus over feature lists
âœ… Personality in technology
âœ… 90% cost reduction through smart routing

The name "Nathan" makes AI feel approachable. Instead of interfacing with a cold 
API, you're asking Nathan for help.
